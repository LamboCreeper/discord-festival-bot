# Discord Festival Bot

Run a festival from within Discord!

## How It Works
1. Invite the bot to your guild
2. Create an event within your guild and make sure you select a voice channel (ideally a stage) as the location
3. Use `/create` and select your event from the dropdown
4. Invite people to submit their DJ sets via `/submit`
5. At the time the event is scheduled for, the bot will automatically start the festival
